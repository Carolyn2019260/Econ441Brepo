      "______________ \n",
      "Artificial Intelligence\n",
      "1. \"AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science.\" There is potential for error here, as the extent of the integration of AI technology varies widely among different industries, governments, or scientific fields.\n",
      "2. \"Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called machine intelligence.\" This may be somewhat misleading as there were many researchers who made substantial contributions to the field of AI, and defining who was first could be subjective or dependent on how one defines \"substantial research\".\n",
      "3. \"Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture.\" The term \"vastly\" is subjective, and whether deep learning \"surpassed all previous AI techniques\" is also a point of debate.\n",
      "4. \"This raises questions about the ethical implications and risks of AI, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\" Statements about what \"raises questions\" or \"prompts discussions\" can be subjective or arbitrary.\n",
      "5. \"The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.\" Not all AI research must necessarily aim at these goals - it depends on the specific project or individual researcher.\n",
      "6. \"General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.\" The idea that the field of AI has one unified set of long-term goals can be misleading due to the diversity of the field.\n",
      "7. \"Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).\" Whether these are the most difficult problems in knowledge representation is up for debate.\n",
      "8. \"A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way, and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state.\" This is not necessarily the only way to use Markov decision processes and characterizing it this way may lead to confusion or misunderstanding.\n",
      "9. \"Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically. It has been a part of AI from the beginning.\" The first sentence is a simplification and may not capture the full scope and complexity of machine learning. The second sentence is potentially false, as machine learning has evolved significantly and incorporating machine learning into AI systems is a relatively recent development.\n",
      "______________ \n",
      "UCLA\n",
      "1. The statement stating that UCLA was established in 1881 as the southern branch of the California State Normal School could be potentially incorrect. UCLA was officially founded in 1919 as the Southern Branch of the University of California.\n",
      "2. The number of undergraduate and graduate degree programs offered by UCLA is stated as 337, but the accurate number may vary. The exact number could fluctuate with potential additions or removals in degree programs each year.\n",
      "3. The number of applications received for Fall 2022 is given as 174,914. This information can be incorrect as the exact number can be different.\n",
      "4. The number of UCLAâ€™s NCAA team championships is listed as 121. This information can be incorrect as the university could have won additional championships after the time this article was written.\n",
      "5. The number of Olympic medals won by 410 Bruins is given as 270 (136 gold, 71 silver, 63 bronze). It is possible that more medals have been won since the information was last updated.\n",
      "6. 27 Nobel laureates, five Turing Award winners, two Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force, and one Fields Medalist have been affiliated with UCLA. This information can be incorrect if further laureates or winners have been affiliated since the time this article was written.\n",
      "7. It's mentioned that UCLA was represented in every Olympics since the university's founding except in 1924. This information can be incorrect if there are any other exceptions not mentioned.\n",
      "8. The number of faculty members elected to the National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, National Academy of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences is listed as 55, 29, 41, and 156 respectively. As electees are named annually, the numbers could be inaccurate by now. \n",
      "9. On May 23, 1919, the school was transformed into the Southern Branch of the University of California. This date could be inaccurate.\n",
      "10. The number of students at the time the new campus was opened in 1929 is mentioned as 5,500. This number could be inaccurate.\n"
